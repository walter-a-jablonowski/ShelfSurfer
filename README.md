# ShelfSurfer

Enables me doing groceries with a long list in 2 places inclding 2 times checkout in 30 min.

- Setup groups.yml (place / sub -> buying and synonyms)
- Capture things using Alexa lists (most easy)
- Export as text, import here (Alexa rest API is deprecated)
- Automatically sorted by sub section where you buy it

See the ~5 items that you need to getRe where you stand. Much faster than running back and forth while doing groceries or scrolling through a long list multiple times.
